Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Electric State and I'm like... wow, what a trip. I mean, it’s like you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , expecting one thing, and then—bam! You get something totally different. Like, what even was that ending? I feel like I need to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the thing just to get what was really happening. You know what I mean?

The visuals though—seriously, stunning! It’s got this Westworld-meets-Mad Max vibe, which is kinda dope. And the robots, man, they got these crazy expressions that almost make you forget they’re, you know, giant tin cans. But then there's like this whole other level where it's trying to say something deep about society or whatever. At least I think that's what it's trying to do. 

Haha, and speaking of society, that one scene with the robot trying to act all human, like, just pretending to have feelings—so ironic, right? Like, give that bot a freaking Oscar! I gotta say, it reminded me of how I kinda fake it till I make it when meeting people at parties. 😂 Anyway, the girl’s journey—it’s intense and a bit sad too. She’s just like wandering through this messed-up world and I'm just here like, Girls, same.

> The part with the dad blew my mind. I mean, there's so much going on with memory and loss, and I was like, whoa. Kinda got me thinking about my own folks, you know? It's weirdly personal, even if it's wrapped in all this sci-fi chaos. It's like, how does this stuff make me feel things? UGH, emotions.

Random side note: Music was on point—like, why do post-apocalyptic stories always have the best soundtracks? It’s like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , and all of a sudden, you’re tapped into some emotional epic playlist for a planet gone wrong. Signed, sealed, delivered, sobbing but smiling.

var randomThought = I don’t know why I’m even typing this code rn;

I dunno, vibes got me all over the place. It’s like the kind of   that sticks with you even when you’re trying to sleep. Anyway, I’m probably overthinking it, but you gotta check it out, man. I swear, we’ve all been here some way or another.
